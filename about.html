		My name is Curtis Asral and I am a sophomore in high school. My favorite 
		hobbies are eating, playing video games, and playing sports. I am in the BRHS 
		Marching Band, pit orchestra, and varsity golf team. I like to challenge myself in
		school by taking challenging classes such as Honors English, Honors History, 
		Honors Science, and AP Calc. I have a brother and 2 cats.
